## Run it

In order to give it a spin, you'll need a couple of things:

1. Get mongodb up and running.
2. Copy `variables.env.sample` in the root, remove `.sample` and fill it with actual data.
3. Run `npm i && npm start` in the command line.
4. Navigate to localhost:[PORT] in your browser, where PORT is the variable set in the `variables.env`.
